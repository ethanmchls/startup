Notes:
The source control stuff in vscode is pretty helpful. A bit more confusing than intellij stuff I'm used to, but still good.

## CSS practice:
I'm trying to learn how to do all my styling in CSS and treat HTML as more of a skeleton. It's hard when doing stuff from the ground up, but it makes more sense with practice.
