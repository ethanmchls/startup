# startup HTML and CSS
I'm pair programming on the startup project. Here's the repository: https://github.com/dannflor/startup

### Tailwind and leaf:
We are using tailwind combined with Leaf by Vapor. This project has taught me a lot about HTML, but it has also been a lot about learning tailwind. I much prefer tailwind over bootstrap and regular CSS. We're also using the DaisuUI plugin for many of the UI components. Before this project, I didn't realize how helpful plugins on top of regular HTML and CSS could be. I like not having to touch a single .css file while writing a webpage. It makes it easier when you can see everything in one place which is why I love tailwind. I also consider flex and media components to be much easier in tailwind than regular CSS. Templating with leaf is also super nice. Though I do worry that it will become a challenge later when we need to use react. Vapor doesn't work with react, so later we'll have to start using JavaScript for templating.

### Backend:
Overall this project wasn't too hard, I think the challenge will be when we start writing the backend. We did a bit of backend to use dummy data and set up some of the models we'll need.

### Overall:
This is an ambitious project, but we're making it work. There have been some unique challenges with responsiveness and scaling, but most of it has been manageable. The biggest challenge we had was making a grid that maintained a square aspect ratio. That was probably the single hardest piece to program. This is going to be a big project. We split the work pretty evenly, but it was still a lot of work for each of us.



## CSS practice:
I'm trying to learn how to do all my styling in CSS and treat HTML as more of a skeleton. It's hard when doing stuff from the ground up, but it makes more sense with practice.

### Flex:
Flex components are pretty straightforward, but in my experience, they're easy to mess up. The basic thing to remember is the `@media screen and (max-width: 600px)` and `flex: 1 20%;` or whatever numbers you need to use for it.

## Simon CSS:
This assignment was more enjoyable than the HTML project because I felt like I could make it a bit more my own. Where HTML is mostly the structure, it was hard to make the first assignment submission unique, but I made this one a bit more unique to me with CSS and various bootstrap components and custom colors.
