Made some changes in vscode
Made some changes in github
Made some more changes in github
Made a conflicting change in vscode

Notes:
The source control stuff in vscode is pretty helpful. A bit more confusing than intellij stuff I'm used to, but still good.

## CSS practice:
I'm trying to learn how to do all my styling in CSS and treat HTML as more of a skeleton. It's hard when doing stuff from the ground up, but it makes more sense with practice.

### Flex:
Flex components are pretty straightforward, but in my experience, they're easy to mess up. The basic thing to remember is the `@media screen and (max-width: 600px)` and `flex: 1 20%;` or whatever numbers you need to use for it.

## Simon CSS:
This assignment was more enjoyable than the HTML project because I felt like I could make it a bit more my own. Where HTML is mostly the structure, it was hard to make the first assignment submission unique, but I made this one a bit more unique to me with CSS and various bootstrap components and custom colors.
